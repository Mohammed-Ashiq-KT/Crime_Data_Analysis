üìä Predicting Crime Trends & Identifying High-Risk Areas Using Machine Learning

1. üéØ Project Goal
   
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand crime patterns, predict future crime occurrences, and identify high-risk areas. These insights are crucial for optimizing law enforcement efforts and implementing preventive measures effectively.

2. üìö Data Source & Description
   
Source: Crime Data from 2020 to Present
Type: Public Open Government Dataset
Format: CSV
Size: 1,005,104 rows √ó 28 columns
Data Types:

float64: 8 columns

int64: 7 columns

object: 13 columns

3. üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used
   
Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn

Machine Learning:

train_test_split (for data splitting)

LabelEncoder (for categorical encoding)

LogisticRegression

RandomForestClassifier

Evaluation Metrics:

accuracy_score

confusion_matrix

classification_report

4. üîç Data Understanding & Cleaning
   
Inspected data shape, types, and null values.

Dropped irrelevant columns such as Report_Type, MO Codes, Crime Code 1/2/3/4, etc.

Checked for and handled missing values.

Converted DATE OCC column to datetime format and extracted Year, Month, Day.

Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

5. üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
Several visualizations were performed to uncover insights:

Top Crimes Reported:

Visualized using bar plots to show the most frequent crime types.

Crime Trends Over Time:

Plotted trends by month and year to detect seasonal or temporal patterns.

Crime by Location:

Analyzed frequency by AREA NAME to identify hotspots.

Relationship Analysis:

Heatmap of correlation matrix to detect relationships between numerical variables.

6. ü§ñ Machine Learning Models
   
a. Logistic Regression

Applied after feature engineering and train-test split.

Accuracy Score: reported based on output in the notebook.

Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.

b. Random Forest Classifier

Implemented as a more robust, ensemble-based alternative.

Compared accuracy with logistic regression.

Results showed higher accuracy and better generalization.

7. üìà Results & Insight
   
The Random Forest model outperformed Logistic Regression.

High-crime areas were identified for strategic planning.

Temporal patterns helped identify peak months/days for crime.

Model predictions can be used for resource allocation and early alerts.

8. ‚úÖ Conclusion
   
This project effectively demonstrates how machine learning and EDA can be applied to public crime datasets to:

Understand urban crime patterns

Build predictive models for future occurrences

Assist authorities in focusing preventive efforts in high-risk zones

Future work could include incorporating geospatial modeling, real-time data, and deep learning for enhanced predictions.
